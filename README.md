# Phoenix.app config

The readme and documentation is in [the source](https://github.com/eirikurn/phoenix-config/blob/master/phoenix.litcoffee). Please read that.

## TLDR:

The config maps the right-hand keys to screen grid cells, four on each screen:

```
UI OP
JK LÃ†
```

By mashing (Ctrl-Alt-Cmd) the buttons, focus is switched to the window in the relevant cell, mashing the same button multiple times cycles focus between windows in the cell.

If you *hard*-mash (Shift-Ctrl-Alt-Cmd) these buttons, the focused window is moved to cover the relevant cell, doing it twice makes it expand across the screen vertically.
